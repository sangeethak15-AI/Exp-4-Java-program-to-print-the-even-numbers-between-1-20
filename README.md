# Exp-4-Java-program-to-print-the-even-numbers-between-1-20
## AIM:
To write a java program to print the even numbers between 1-20.

## PROCEDURE:
1.Import required packages.

2.Declare main method with the signature "public static void main(String[] args)".

3.By using a for look we can print even numbers 4.By initilizin i as 0 and i less than or equal to 20 and increment i

4.Display the output
## PROGRAM:
```
public class even {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i=1;i<=20;i++)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
            {
                System.out.println("Even numbers: "+i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
